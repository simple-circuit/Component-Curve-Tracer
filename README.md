# Component-Curve-Tracer
Uno based bipolar +-12V sine wave curve tracer. Uses PWM to generate sine and step waveforms.
Circuit has Dual Op Amp, resistors and capacitors. 
Needs four 9V batteries or a 5V to +-15 DC to DC converter. 
Application uno_pwm_ct.exe for viewing waveforms (includes source code). 
Arduino sketch and Fritzing file to aid building.
